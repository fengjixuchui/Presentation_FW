## slide 05 [Installing UEFI Driver Wizard]
### Installing UEFI Driver Wizard

### Requirements and Options

- Workspace  must contain BaseTools, MdePkg & MdeModulePkg Packages from tianocore.org edk2 for Driver development on Tianocore.org 

- Uses previous lab’s setup w/ Windows $HOME/fw/edk2-ws

- Python* scripts from <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-share/tree/master/DriverDeveloper/UefiDriverWizard"> Github Link </a> then use instructions from README for Python and wxPython versions to install then run
```
	 bash$ python launch.py
		
```

Note:



---
## slide 07 Template File Contents
<b>Template File Contents </b>

- Proper UEFI driver entry point 
- Basic driver libraries/headers
- Skeletons for common driver functions



- Error values until ported EFI_UNSUPPORTED, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR




Note:
- Establishes a proper UEFI Driver Entry Point
- References to basic driver libraries/headers based on Driver Wizard form input
- Inserted in .INF, .H and .C files
- Skeletons for common driver functions
- Includes comments based on information from the Driver Writer’s Guide for UEFI 2.3.1
- Functions may return error values until ported : (EFI_UNSUPPORTED, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR)

## slide 08 Lab 1: Create a UEFI Driver section


### Lab 1: Create a UEFI Driver with the UEFI Driver Wizard

- In this lab, you'll create a new UEFI driver using the UEFI Driver Wizard.
- This will create a set of "c" code files to be used as a template UEFI Driver used in the subsequent driver labs

## slide 09 [Lab 1: Install UEFI Driver Wizard ]

### Lab 1: Install UEFI Driver Wizard

1. First setup for Building EDK II with Linux [Setup](https://github.com/tianocore-training/Presentation_FW/blob/main/FW/Presentations/Lab_Guides/_L_C_01_Build_Setup_Download_EDK_II_Linux_LabGuide.md)
2. From the ~FW/DriverWizard folder, copy and paste folder "~FW/DriverWizard/UefiDriverWizard" to ~$Home 
3. Check  if version 2.7.x is the default of Python from Terminal Prompt 
```
  bash$ python --version
    Python 2.7.12
```
4. Install the wxPython  (Version 3.0 )
```
 bash$ sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0 
```
